Tool to perform an ARP Man In The Middle Attack on a network.

The ARP protocol is a network protocol that translates IP addresses (Layer 3) to MAC addresses (Layer 2) within a local area network (LAN). This protocol can be used by a computer to trick other devices into believing that it is the router, thereby recieving the devices network traffic. To facilitate a normal internet connection on the victims device, the packets must be forwarded onto the router and replies from router must be forwarded back onto victims device, hence the Man in the Middle.

Internet speeds can be throttled or blocked by dropping a percentage of incoming packages from the victims device before forwarding them to the real router.
